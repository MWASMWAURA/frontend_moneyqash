## üîß Backend Requirements

For these frontend improvements to work properly, your backend needs to support:

### API Endpoints Required:

1. `GET /api/user/stats` - Should return UserStats with all referral levels
2. `GET /api/user/referrals` - Should return referrals with level information
3. `GET /api/user/earnings` - Should return earnings with source categorization
4. `GET /api/user/withdrawals` - Should return withdrawals with status tracking
5. `POST /api/user/withdraw` - Should handle withdrawal requests properly

### Data Requirements:

#### Referral Tracking Logic:

```javascript
// When a user (B) signs up with user A's referral code:
1. Create Level 1 referral record (A -> B)
2. Credit A with referral commission (300 Sh for first, 150 Sh for additional)

// When user B refers user C:
3. Create Level 1 referral record (B -> C)
4. Create Level 2 referral record (A -> C via B)
5. Credit A with secondary referral commission
6. Credit B with their direct referral commission
```

#### Earnings Tracking:

- All earnings should be recorded in the `earnings` table with proper `source` field
- Sources: 'referral', 'ad', 'youtube', 'tiktok', 'instagram'
- Include proper descriptions for each earning entry

#### Withdrawal Processing:

- Update user balances when withdrawals are processed
- Track withdrawal status ('pending', 'completed', 'failed')
- Implement proper fee deduction (50 Sh per withdrawal)
- Update `accountBalance` and relevant earning balances

### Database Schema Updates Required:

- Ensure `referrals` table has `level` field (1 for direct, 2 for secondary)
- Ensure `earnings` table tracks all income sources properly
- Ensure `withdrawals` table tracks status and processing details
- Consider adding `withdrawal_balance` tracking per source if needed

## üì± Features Now Available

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `VITE_API_URL` is properly set for your Render backend
2. **API Endpoints**: Verify all API endpoints are implemented and returning correct data
3. **CORS**: Ensure proper CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
4. **Authentication**: Verify cookie-based authentication works with your backend

## üîç Testing Checklist

- [ ] Referral tracking works for Level 1 referrals

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend Changes**: Implement the referral tracking logic on your Render backend
2. **Test Referral Flow**: Verify the complete referral tracking works end-to-end
3. **Test Withdrawal Flow**: Ensure withdrawals properly update balances
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check that the new components don't impact page load times
5. **User Testing**: Get feedback from users on the improved interface

The frontend is now ready to handle sophisticated referral tracking and earnings management. The backend implementation will determine how well these features work in practice.
